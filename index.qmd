## Welcome
I am Mohammad Nasirpour, a cancer researcher at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. My current research focuses on employing Spatial Transcriptomics to investigate breast cancer, specifically aiming to understand the biological mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression. Through this work, I am dedicated to identifying novel biomarkers for early disease detection.

My research integrates advanced spatial analysis techniques with molecular biology to map gene expression patterns within tumor tissues, providing crucial insights into cancer development. This approach allows us to better understand the complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment and potentially discover new therapeutic targets.
